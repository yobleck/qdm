# QDM
Is a terminal user interface(TUI) display/login manager written in Python(3.10) for Linux,

featuring the ability to choose between different desktop environments(DE)

and window managers(WM) via `/usr/share/xsessions/*.desktop` files.

QDM also supports multiple user login options and ASCII art style animations.

The UI is shamelessly ripped from [Ly](https://github.com/fairyglade/ly) another TUI DM.

The reason QDM exists is because Ly's large (too large for such a simple program IMO)

codebase is no longer being actively maintained.

QDM is a hobby project and security is not my strong suit so feel free to critique that.
